Problem Statement
In Philaland island there is smart group of problem solvers. They are assigned with the following task-



Given: Different types of coins or coins of different denominations (S)

           Certain amount (N)

Query: Find out the total number of ways you can make the change of the given amount using the coins given. The order of coins doesn���t matter.



Example



For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4. For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6}, there are five solutions: {2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} and {5,5}. So the output should be 5
